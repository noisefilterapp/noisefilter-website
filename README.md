# Noise Filter Web Browser Extension

Noise Filter is an extension for your web browser that hides the comment sections from popular news and social media websites. The extension offers the ability to pause the functionality and whitelist specific websites. For more information, please visit the [Noise Filter website](https://noisefilterapp.github.io/).

## How do I install the extension

Noise Filter is currently available for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge:

* **Firefox**: [Noise Filter for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/noise-filter/)
* **Chrome**: [Noise Filter for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amdamikbiepicglbfbgfmjjhemodckim/publish-accepted?authuser=0&hl=en)
* **Edge**: [Noise Filter for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/lmepanbjainklihelienhhbgmggmpgoi)

## Using Noise Filter without installing the web extension

If you wish to use the application without downloading the extension, please feel free to download the [content.css](https://github.com/noisefilterapp/noisefilter/blob/master/src/style/css/content.css) file. Most modern web browser allow you to insert custom stylesheets, however, using this method you will not have access to the pause and whitelist features that are packaged with the web extension.

You are also free to use the stylesheet in a new project if you so wish.
